## Welcome to my Kanban board!

This project is a simple task management tool. Each task that you add can be in one of three states:
1. To do
2. Doing
3. Done

This Kanban board has the following functionalities:

1. Create a new task
2. Add description of the task
3. Mov3 tasks from one state to another (for example, from to do to doing)
4. Delete tasks
