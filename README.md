# 🛠️ Kanban Board Task Manager

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Welcome to my **Kanban Board** project!  
This is a lightweight and user-friendly **task management tool** where tasks can flow through three key stages:

- **To Do** ✅
- **Doing** 🚧
- **Done** 🎯

The Kanban board helps users **visualize work**, **track progress**, and **organize tasks** efficiently — perfect for personal productivity, project tracking, or small team collaboration.

## 📚 Additional Notes

- The app typically runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` — open this link in your browser after starting the server.
- Tasks persist during your session. Refresh the page to see real-time updates after moving or deleting tasks.
- Ideal for learning basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and **state management** in simple web applications.
